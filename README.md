This section provides a "lightning-quick" guide for early access of Satori users such as:
- Howto optain your login credentials
- Howto connect in the Satori cluster via SSH/SCP/HTTPS
- [Installing Python](https://github.com/mit-satori/getting-started/blob/master/satori-ai-frameworks.md) environment (Anaconda) on your login profile
- [Installing WMLCE](https://github.com/mit-satori/getting-started/blob/master/satori-ai-frameworks.md) optimized Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries and frameworks  on your login profile
- Examples of training jobs submision to the Workload Manager
- Examples of Distributed Deep Learning with [TensorFlow](https://github.com/IBM/powerai/tree/master/examples/tensorflow_large_model_support/v2) and Pytorch
- Examples of Large Model Support implementation in [TensorFlow](https://github.com/IBM/powerai/tree/master/examples/tensorflow_large_model_support/v2) and Pytorch
- Example on [IBM SnapML](https://github.com/IBM/powerai/tree/master/examples/SnapML)
- [Additional trainings](https://github.com/mit-satori/getting-started/blob/master/satori-training.md) (video format) for CUDA UNIFIED MEMORY, GPUDirect, LSF Workload Manager, POWER9 SMT4 etc
